# Property_Risk_Classification
This model will classify the property into High risk or Low risk mortgage insurace category based on various property details.  This ML model is designed in such a way that it is designed to provide a chance/risk of an insurance claim for a given property using various factors. The higher the risk of claim, the higher the insurance premium set for that property and increases the companyâ€™s capital requirements.

Machine learning Binary classification is used for building this model. Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms are used for making this ML model.
